This project was bootstrapped with [Create Inferno App](https://github.com/infernojs/create-inferno-app) then ejected to expose all configuration files and allow customizations.

Inferno-Habitat, at the moment, is a local dependency in `src/_inferno-habitat` until I manage to get a working npm package.

## Work in Progress

- Cleanup unnecessary files and configurations

- Add support for:
    - SCSS
    - ~~Typescript~~

- Cleanup example component:
    - Styling
    - Include "output" props

- Production build
    - Split packages for self contained and embeddable (maybe this is NPM's job?)
    - Packaging (NPM)?

- ~~Fix Jest's `document.getElementById` issue~~
